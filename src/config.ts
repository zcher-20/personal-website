I'm Zayneb Cherif, a B.A. Computer Science & Design student at Columbia University (Class of 2028), previously at NYU. I work at the intersection of AI research, full-stack engineering, and human-centered design.

&nbsp;

My research spans analog in-memory computing, RAG systems, agentic AI pipelines, and quantum-classical ML — with publications at ICLR 2024 (Notable) and IJCAI 2024. On the engineering side I build everything from FastAPI backends and LLM applications to multimodal AI civic platforms.

&nbsp;

I speak English, Arabic, Italian, and Spanish, and I'm driven by the belief that the best technology is both rigorous and humane.

&nbsp;

Recognized at ICLR 2024 (Notable), IBM/IEEE AICS 2023, Best Research Award at the University of Sharjah, Genius Olympiad Finalist, and WESEF Finalist.
